    "A *recommender system* or a *recommendation system* (sometimes replacing \"system\" with a synonym such as a *platform* or an *engine*) is a subclass of information filtering system that seeks to predict the \"rating\" or \"preference\" a user would give to an item.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recommender systems are utilized in a variety of areas including movies, music, news, books, research articles, search queries, social tags, and products in general. There are also recommender systems for experts, collaborators, jokes, restaurants, garments, financial services, life insurance, romantic partners (online dating), and Twitter pages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recommender systems typically produce a list of recommendations in one of two ways:\n",
    " - Non-personalized approach\n",
    " - Personalized approach\n",
    " \n",
    "Personalized-based recommender systems also have common subtypes:\n",
    " - Collaborative filtering recommender systems\n",
    " - Content-based recommender systems\n",
    " \n",
    "All the techniques mentioned above have their problems and pitfalls, which developers face creating and applying recommender systems to real-world problems. They must be taken into account while designing the system architecture and will be covered later in this work. Though the field of recommendation itself is relatively old, there are still no solutions that work perfectly for every case. Designing and evaluating a recommender system is hard, and requires a deep understanding of domain knowledge and data available, as well as constant experimenting and modification. First recommender systems appeared a long time ago in the 1990s, but the intense research started quite recently with the availability of better computational power and tremendous amounts of data coming from the internet.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the events that energized research in recommender systems was the Netflix Prize. From 2006 to 2009, Netflix sponsored a competition, offering a grand prize of $1,000,000 to the team that could take an offered dataset of over 100 million movie ratings and return recommendations that were 10% more accurate than those offered by the company's existing recommender system.\n",
    "\n",
    "This competition energized the search for new and more accurate algorithms. The most accurate algorithm in 2007 used an ensemble method of 107 different algorithmic approaches, blended into a single prediction:\n",
    "\n",
    ">Predictive accuracy is substantially improved when blending multiple predictors. Our experience is that most efforts should be concentrated in deriving substantially different approaches, rather than refining a single technique. Consequently, our solution is an ensemble of many methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Beside classical approaches to recommendation with techniques described above, there are a lot of different cases that require modifications or special settings:\n",
    " - Group recommender systems\n",
    " - Context-aware recommender systems\n",
    " - Risk-aware recommender systems"

The content of each item is represented as a set of descriptors or terms, typically the words that occur in a document. The user profile is represented with the same terms and built up by analyzing the content of items which have been seen by the user.\n",

    "Several issues have to be considered when implementing a content-based filtering system. First, terms can either be assigned automatically or manually. When terms are assigned automatically a method has to be chosen that can extract these terms from items. Second, the terms have to be represented such that both the user profile and the items can be compared in a meaningful way. Third, a learning algorithm has to be chosen that can learn the user profile based on seen items and can make recommendations based on this user profile.\n",

It is based on the idea that people who agreed in their evaluation of certain items in the past are likely to agree again in the future.

The recommendations of some friends who have similar interests are trusted more than recommendations from others. This information is used in the decision on which movie to see.\n",

Neighborhood size is a hyperparameter which needs to be tuned in every system. Distance between neighbors can be defined using such metrics as cosine similarity.\n",

    "Building a good recommender system is not an easy task. Although some algorithms are considered \"best practices\", they all have their strengths and weaknesses. Developing a recommender system requires a good understanding of domain users, data that can be collected, and purposes of our recommendation. Without knowing all the things mentioned above, it is impossible to design a good recommender system, no matter how complicated are algorithms you use. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, there are common techniques that are commonly used by themselves and in combination. Modern recommender systems still use collaborative filtering and content filtering techniques, although nowadays these algorithms are used in combination and with the application of such more advanced techniques as matrix factorization, neural networks, and hybrid recommender systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "The field of recommender systems is constantly developing, providing us with new studies on context-based recommendation, risk-aware, and group recommendations, as well as research in different evaluation methods and iterative factorization techniques. There are dozens of ways to design a recommender, and choosing \"the best\" approach is up to people who know why and how they want to make recommendations."
