    "Welcome to this weeks notebook. This time we will look at the technique of *ensembling*. More precisely, we will first look at the ensemble model XGBoost and then investigate the concept of an ensemble of models. So you see that we will look at ensembling on two different scales which can easily be combined to make an ensemble of ensembles.\n",

    "You work for a Data Sciences consulting company and got a new contract with an influencing company that wants to know what makes an Instagram post popular so that they can increase their engagement. To start simple, you will only consider information from the author of the post, metadata about the post and temporal information regarding the post.\n",

    "Your goal is to predict the number of likes (a proxy for engagement) a post will get and then try to explain which components are relevant to get a high engagement."

These out-of-fold predictions can now be used to train the *meta-model* without overfitting to the predictions of base models. This is the concept of stacked generalization since we are stacking models but only use \"unseen\" data every time we fit a model.\n",
